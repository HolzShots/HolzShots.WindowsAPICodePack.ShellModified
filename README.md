# WindowsAPICodePack.ShellModified

A modified version of the Windows API Code Pack that does not contain references to WPF. Also, it's focused on taskbar-related APIs that are used in [HolzShots](https://github.com/nikeee/HolzShots).
 The goal is to replace this with native Winforms APIs as soon as they have these features.
